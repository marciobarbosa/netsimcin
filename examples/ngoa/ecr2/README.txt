The 'ecr2' is a set of simulation models and scenarios for equivalent
circuit rate (ECR)-based study of 10-Gb/s next-generation optical
access architectures based on OMNeT++ and INET, which implements a
complete end-to-end communication environment for model architectures
including a TCP/IP protocol stack, application protocols, and user
behavioral models for traffic generation.
