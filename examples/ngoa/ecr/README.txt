The 'ecr' is a set of simulation models and scenarios for equivalent
circuit rate (ECR)-based study of next-generation optical access
architectures based on OMNeT++ and INET, which implements a complete
end-to-end communication environment for model architectures including
a TCP/IP protocol stack, application protocols, and user behavioral
models for traffic generation.
