Hybrid TDM/WDM-Passive Optical Network (PON)
============================================

The "hybridpon" provides essential components at Physical and MAC
layers to build simulation models for various flavors of hybrid time
division multiplexing (TDM)/wavelength division multiplexing
(WDM)-passive optical network (PON) systems.


* Features:
Modular design allows dynamic loading of different MAC and schedulers
at run time.


* Notes:
This project was originally started as a joint work between Stanford
Networking Research Center (SNRC), Photonics & Networking Research Lab
(PNRL), Stanford, and Advanced System Technology (AST),
STMicrolectronics, and resulted in Stanford University Access-Hybrid
PON (SUCCESS-HPON) simulation models for OMNeT++ version 3.
  
To integrate the models into INET/OMNeT++ for working with
full-fledged TCP/IP models and extend them to other flavors of hybrid
PONs, however, we decided to virtually start from scratch. Now the
whole code base (i.e., "inet-hnrl") is maintained by Hybrid Networking
Research Lab (HNRL), Swansea University, Wales, UK.
