    * PathLossReceptionModel.h/cc, Ieee80211Radio.ned: checked in shadowing
    component patch from Nikos Simantirakis (simantirakis@rt-solutions.de).
    "It implements a shadowing component for the path loss reception model.
    This random variable has a normal distribution in dB and results to
    log-normal distribution in mW. This is a widespread and common model
    used for reproducing shadowing effects (Rappaport, T. S. (2002),
    Wireless Communications - Principles and Practice, Prentice Hall PTR)."
